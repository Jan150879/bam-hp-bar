# BAM-HP-Bar 

Shows hidden HP-Bar for field boss BAMs: Ortan, Cerrus, Hazard 


# Important Notes 

- stay close to the BAM so you won't miss any damage done to it, else module would show bigger HP value than it actually is 

# Commands

- `bamhp` - to toggle module to not react on appearing monsters near you
